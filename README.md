# tactful

`tactful` is my personal contact manager. It is a small and simple CLI tool written in Rust.

The functionality of `tactful` is intentionally very limited. The contact list is stored in a JSON
file and changes to it need to be applied manually in the JSON file.

This project is primarily intended for personal use, but you are of course free to use it for your
own purposes.
